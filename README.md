# California Housing Price Prediction

This project uses the **California Housing** dataset—derived from the 1990 census—to predict the **median house value per census block** based on socioeconomic and geographic features. The goal is to build regression models capable of accurately estimating median home prices. Three different algorithms were implemented and compared:

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  

Each model’s performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and visualizations are provided to compare predicted versus actual values.
